"""Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string

Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.

For example:

remove_chars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Here, we need to remove the first four characters from a string.
remove_chars("pynative", 2) so output must be native. Here, we need to remove the first two characters from a string.
Note: n must be less than the length of the string.
